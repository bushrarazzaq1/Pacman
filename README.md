# Pacman
This is a classic Pacman-style game developed using Python and Pygame, designed as a semester project for the subject Data Structures & Algorithms (CE-205L). The objective of the game is not only entertainment but also to integrate and demonstrate core DSA concepts such as pathfinding, node-based movement, and game state logic.
